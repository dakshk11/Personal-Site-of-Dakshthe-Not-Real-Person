          <em><p>A <strong>Child</strong> learning how to code.</p></em>
          <p>I was born in the sunny morning. After that day I had always wanted to be a coder. In 2015 I started to learn how to code in python. In 2020 I learned <a href= "https://brainstation.io/career-guides/what-is-web-development#:~:text=Web%20development%2C%20also%20known%20as,web%20programming%2C%20and%20database%20management.">Web Development</a>. I have just started to learn Java and C++. I have been taught by 15 teachers around the world and can speak Spanish, English, and Hindi. Some of my favorite apps are VS Code Editor, Pycharm, Microsoft Teams, Discord, and Google Chrome. I have been doing coding for 7 years and hope to do more coding ahead in life.
